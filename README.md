**🏦 ATM Network Dashboard – Global ATM Performance & Insights**
**1. Project Title / Headline**
A dynamic and interactive Power BI dashboard designed to monitor and analyze ATM transactions, uptime, cash refills, and regional performance across multiple branches and cities worldwide. This dashboard provides stakeholders with actionable insights for operational efficiency and financial decision-making.

**2. Short Description / Purpose**
The ATM Network Dashboard is a visually engaging Power BI solution created to analyze transaction volumes, ATM uptime, projected cash refill needs, and regional performance trends. It empowers financial institutions and operations teams to track performance, optimize cash management, and improve ATM service levels across geographies.

**3. Tech Stack**
The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:
📊 Power BI Desktop – Main data visualization and reporting tool.
📂 Power Query – For data collection, cleaning, and transformation from multiple sources.
🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Used for advanced KPIs, time intelligence, RANKX, and dynamic calculations.
📝 Data Modeling – Star schema with optimized relationships, calculated columns, and measures.
🌍 Power BI Map Visuals – To display regional transaction volumes globally.
🔗 SQL – For querying, integrating, and validating data sources.

**4. Data Source
**
The dataset simulates a global ATM transaction system, including details such as:
Daily transactions across multiple ATMs
ATM uptime percentages
Cash refill requirements (USD)
Regional and city-level performance metrics
Top-performing ATMs and cities based on transaction volume
(Data used in this dashboard is anonymized and structured for demonstration purposes.)

**5. Features / Highlights
• Business Problem**

Banks and financial institutions face challenges in tracking ATM performance, predicting cash refill needs, and identifying high/low performing regions in real-time. Raw data is difficult to interpret without a visual, interactive system.

**• Goal of the Dashboard**
To create an interactive Power BI dashboard that:
Provides real-time monitoring of ATM transactions and uptime.
Helps forecast cash refill requirements.
Identifies top-performing ATMs and regions.
Enables management to make data-driven operational decisions.
